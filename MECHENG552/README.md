## [Introduction]
This ducument is used for recording some notes for mechatronic systems designing. Lab 1 is about basics of electronic circuits.
## [Electronic Circuits]
* voltage, current, power
* how to determine the passive source and active source elements in a circuit.
    * passive sign convenntion(PSC)
    * resistors, capacitors, inductance are passive source elements 
    * voltage source, current source are active source elements 
* electircal impedance compared to mechanical impedance
