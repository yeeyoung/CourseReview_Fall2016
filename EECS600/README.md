This file is used for reviewing concepts(keywords) excerpted from lectures.  
<u>*09-06-2016*</u>  
__field__: 5 addition + 5 multiplicaiton axioms + distributivity  
__vector space__: addition + scalar multiplication   

<u>*09-08-2016*</u>  
__span__: the linear combinations of all vector in a sutset S  
__subspace__:  
__linearly independent__:  
__finite dimensional__:  
__basis__:  
__convex set__:  
__the sum of two subsets__:  
__convex cover__ = __convex hull__ï¼š *co()*  
__a cone with vertex at origin__:  
__normed vector space__: 3 conditions e.g. a continuous function with maximum norm  
__interior point__, __closure point__:  
__open set__, __closed set__:  
__convergent sequence__:  
__limit point__:  

<u>*09-13-2016*</u>  
__Cauchy Sequence__:  
__complete__:  
__Banach Space__: a complete normed vector space  
a special example proof of that continuous function with maximum norm defined on a closed set is a Banach Space  
__the convergent limit function is continuous__: we first need several definitiions  
__transformation__:  
__transformation is continuous at point x0__:  
a counter example proof of that continuous function with absolute integral norm defined on a closed real axis is not a Banach Space.(put forward a special test case)  
__closed subset of Banach Space is complete and vice versa__  
__inner product__: satisfy 3 conditions
