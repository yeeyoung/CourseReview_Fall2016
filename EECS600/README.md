<u>*09-06-2016*</u>  
__field__: 5 addition + 5 multiplicaiton axioms + distributivity  
__vector space__: addition + scalar multiplication   

<u>*09-08-2016*</u>  
__span__: the linear combinations of all vector in a sutset S  
__subspace__:  
__linearly independent__:  
__finite dimensional__:  
__basis__:  
__convex set__:  
__the sum of two subsets__:  
__convex cover__ = __convex hull__ï¼š *co()*  
__a cone with vertex at origin__:  
__normed vector space__: 3 conditions e.g. a continuous function with maximum norm  
__interior point__, __closure point__:  
__open set__, __closed set__:  
__convergent sequence__:  
__limit point__:  

<u>*09-13-2016*</u>  
__Cauchy Sequence__:  
__complete__:  
__Banach Space__: a complete normed vector space  
a special example proof of that continuous function with maximum norm defined on a closed set is a Banach Space  
__the convergent limit function is continuous__: we first need several definitiions  
__transformation__:  
__transformation is continuous at point x0__:  
a counter example proof of that continuous function with absolute integral norm defined on a closed real axis is not a Banach Space.(put forward a special test case)  
__closed subset of Banach Space is complete and vice versa__  
__inner product__: satisfy 3 conditions  

<u>*09-15-2016*</u> To make it easier to review the material, I do not want to accentuate each terminology any more.  
Cauchy-Schwartz inequality  
normed vector space  
Banach space  
Inner Product space (Pre-Hilbert Space)  
Hilbert Space  
Projection Problem  
How to decide the existance and uniqueness of the solution to projection problem  
Orthogonality Principle for inner product space  
Projection Theorem for closed subspace of Hilbert Space (proof)  
Orthogonality Principle for convex subset of inner product space  
Projection Theorem for closed convex subset of Hilbert Space  
Lp and lp normed space  
Holder's inequality  
Minkowski's inequality  
How to prove Minkowski inequality from Holder's inequality, which conditions for equality holds and what p, q conditions for inequality and equality holds for two formulas.  
Some notes that clarify conceptions like "complete", "compact", "closure" etc have been recorded in review1.pdf uploaded into this folder.  
<u>*09-28-2016*</u>  
Frame is a subset of vectors in Hilbert space, they can be linearly independent or linearly dependend, but at least they must span the whole Hilbert space.  
More information about frame theory please refer to Frame.pdf  
__Wavelet Theory__  
<u>*10-01-2016*</u>  
__strictly normed Banach Space__: the last problem in HW2  
__strictly convex set__  
__Heine-Borel Theorem__: compact = complete + totally bounded  
__Variational Problem__: functional.pdf illustrates the existance and uniqueness of the solution to projection problems: Arbitray Banach Space + closed convex subset  
__Projection Theorem for Convex Subset in Hilbert Space__: proved by Parallelogram identity + completeness of Hilbert Space + convex property  
__Projection for Conve Subset in arbitrary Banach Space__: existance (to prove the compactness of Banach Space), uniqueness (see whether the convex subset is strictly convex)
